# Multi-Project README

## Face Mask Detection with TensorFlow and Keras

This project focuses on detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using TensorFlow and Keras. It employs a deep learning model to classify images as mask or no mask. The dataset used for training and testing the model should be prepared and organized in a suitable manner.

## Student Attendance System with Realtime Database

This project implements an Attendance Marking Machine with a real-time database. To use this code, you need to set up your own database using "Firebase" (for free). The project includes a folder named "Images" where you can place student images for recognition. The system marks attendance based on face recognition and updates the real-time database.

## ASL Detector with TensorFlow and Keras

In this project, an American Sign Language (ASL) detector has been created using TensorFlow and Keras. The model has been trained using Google's Teachable Machine. It can predict ASL signs from images of hand gestures, enabling communication with individuals who use ASL.

## Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This program utilizes logistic regression with cross-validation to develop a model that estimates the likelihood of heart disease based on important indicators. The indicators include sex, age, BMI, smoking habits, medical history, and other health-related attributes. The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and additional synthetic samples were generated to balance the data distribution.

### Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required Python packages for each project.

For Face Mask Detection:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install tensorflow
```

For Student Attendance System:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install firebase-admin
```

For ASL Detector:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
```

For Heart Disease Prediction:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install sklearn
pip install imblearn
pip install pylab
```

### Program Execution

Navigate to the respective project directory and follow the instructions in the project-specific README or Jupyter Notebook for execution.

For example, to run the Heart Disease Prediction program, launch the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Heart\ Disease\ Prediction.ipynb
```

Please ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed before running each project.

```

Please adjust the installation and execution instructions as needed based on the actual structure and requirements of your projects. Additionally, provide any necessary details about dataset sources, file structures, and usage instructions for each project.
